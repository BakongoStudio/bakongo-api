# Bakongo Agency Back-End

On this repo I'm gona make the back-end of the bakongo agency web app.

To finish this without any problems I'm planning to divide this app in many other steps.

---

1. We going to config all the routes, but why I choose this first, couse for being the least complex.

2. Create our Model & Cotrollers.

Other steps I will add during the project don't wory just give a star...
